## Motivation and Overview
Solar power is crucial in addressing the escalating global energy crisis and mitigating 
environmental degradation. As a renewable and inexhaustible resource, solar energy offers 
a sustainable alternative to finite fossil fuels. With advances in technology, more 
governements and utility providers have started investing in solar farms. As such, 
it becomes imperative to optimize the site selection of utility-scale solar farms.

### Project Description
This project is an innovative solution designed to streamline the site selection process 
for utility-scale solar energy farms. Leveraging geospatial data analytics and machine 
learning algorithms, our predictive models assess various factors, including: solar 
irradiance, topography, land use, and population. Then, we provide a recommendation 
system for potential solar power farms, on which our stakeholders can conduct a few 
extra studies before investment and construction. This system significantly reduces 
time and resources spent on research, and thus, is an indispensable tool for our 
stakeholders.
