## Motivation and Overview
Solar power is crucial in addressing the escalating global energy crisis and mitigating 
environmental degradation. As a renewable and inexhaustible resource, solar energy offers 
a sustainable alternative to finite fossil fuels. With advances in technology, more 
governements and utility providers have started investing in solar farms. As such, 
it becomes imperative to optimize the site selection of utility-scale solar farms.
